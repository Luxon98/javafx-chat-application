# Chat application utilizing JavaFX

#### This repository contains a server that uses multi-threading, Socket and ServerSocket classes to support multiple clients as well as an application with a graphical user interface for clients.
#### The application uses the remote MySql database to store conversations or user data.

Functionalities:

 - The application allows you to register an account and login
 - Using the application we can send messages to active or inactive friends
 - The program allows you to add / remove friends and choose one of the avatars that are available
 - The application displays online / offline statuses as well as simple notifications


##### I didn't use any frameworks because I wanted to practice developing servers in Java and Java programming language itself.
##### The application is not ideal in terms of architecture. In addition, because it is an application created for educational purposes, I used a very simple email address validation and imposed low password requirements.

The server was tested using Heroku hosting (and of course on a local host).
